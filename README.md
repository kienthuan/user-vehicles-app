# user-vehicles-app
Interview assignment:

Think about a web application that would enable the end user to add their vehicles, write when did they do any maintenance on that vehicle, how much was the cost, what was the date and some comments. Each user can have as many or as little vehicle as he likes but a single vehicle can only belong to a single user. Also, a user might sell a vehicle to another user so the whole maintenance history should be transfered.

Your task is to create a simple REST API using Java or Kotlin and Spring Boot (and additional libraries you thing are needed).
The REST API should cover the mentioned scenarios in the text, which means having at least the endpoints for (but not limited to):
1. Creating a vehicle
2. Creating a user
3. Adding vehicles to users
4. Transfering ownership to another user
5. Adding, editing and deleting a maintenance record

- The solution must be delivered using some git repository like GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc...
- Think about your solution as a production-ready solution. What you consider to be a production ready project is up you. 
- If a persistance layer is needed, please use the H2 database.

Please deliver the solution in the next 10 days.
